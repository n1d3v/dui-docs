title: <element>
---

An `<element>` in DirectUI can be many things, it can be the body of a DirectUI page, it can be text, it can be a spacer, there is not really a way to describe it. The best way to describe an element is that it is anything that can be rendered. It is similar to a `<div>` in HTML.

### Examples
You can use an `<element>` as a body for your content like:

```xml
<duixml>
    <element resid="main" layout="borderlayout()">
        <!-- Content -->
    </element>
</duixml>
```

You can use an `<element>` as text like:

```xml
<element layoutpos="top" content="Hello world!" />
```
