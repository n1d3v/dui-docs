title: Introduction to DirectUI
---

### What is DirectUI?
DirectUI is a XAML / WPF-like language made by Microsoft used mainly in areas around the Windows Control Panel and Microsoft software such as Windows Live Messenger. This language was completely undocumented by Microsoft. People nowadays use DirectUI to modify Windows components or make Control Panel applets.

### What is the purpose of this website?
The purpose of this website all of this documentation is to:

1. Document DirectUI properly with examples on how to use it
2. Have all of the DirectUI information in one easy to access place
3. Let people contribute their own information so more can be discovered and made

DirectUI information has been scattered all over forums, Discord servers and other places, so this brings it all together.

### Is there anything that can help me further with DirectUI?
The answer is yes, there are tools that can certainly help. One of these tools is [Leet's DUI Toolkit](https://github.com/leetftw/Leet.UI.DuiKit). It contains a DirectUI notepad which is very useful for writing up quick DirectUI to test and a compiler for your DirectUI code.

If you want to create Control Panel applets, a fork of the Rectify11 Control Panel applet by AllieTheFox is highly recommended. The backend has been reimplemented to act like a real applet. You can find it [here](https://github.com/AllieTheFox/RectifyControlPanel2).
